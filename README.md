## Welcome

Welcome to the repository containing the code for my personal website [john-drago.github.io](https://john-drago.github.io). I wrote the vast majority of this code in November of 2019 when creating an online portfolio for graduate school applications. 

The template is original and was made with help with HTML and CSS from [w3schools.com] (https://www.w3schools.com/). 

I periodically update the code to add new gadgets to the website or to emulate something I've seen online. I mostly update the files that are contained on the website for my personal portfolio. My hope is that the website is a living, breathing repository of my professional development for years to come.

Thank you for visiting my website!

~John
